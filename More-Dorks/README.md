## Introduction

The More Dorks repository serves as a vital resource for security professionals, penetration testers, and developers involved in security assessment and testing of web applications. It offers an extensive collection of categorized dorks for identifying potential security weaknesses.

## Purpose

This repository aims to provide a structured catalog of dorks categorized by specific vulnerability types, assisting users in identifying potential security weaknesses in web applications. It's designed to streamline security assessment and testing efforts.

## Categories of Dorks

The repository categorizes dorks into specific types, each representing common security vulnerabilities frequently encountered in web applications. Each category offers a targeted selection of dorks relevant to that specific vulnerability type.

### Categories

1. **SQL Injection**: Dorks for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Dorks targeting XSS vulnerabilities.
3. **Path Traversal**: Dorks for identifying path traversal vulnerabilities.
4. **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**: Dorks related to LFI vulnerabilities.
5. **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**: Dorks focused on RFI vulnerabilities.
6. **Error-based Injection**: Dorks centered around error-based injection vulnerabilities.
7. **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection**: Dorks related to time-based blind SQL injection vulnerabilities.
8. **Server-Side Template Injection**: Dorks targeting server-side template injection.
9. **Directory Listing**: Dorks designed to find directory listings.
10. **Command Injection**: Dorks for identifying command injection vulnerabilities.
11. **XML External Entity (XXE)**: Dorks for XXE vulnerabilities.
12. **Authentication Bypass**: Dorks aimed at identifying authentication bypass vulnerabilities.
13. **Header Injection**: Dorks for finding header injection vulnerabilities.

Each category contains a range of dorks designed to uncover vulnerabilities specific to that type.

## Examples of Dorks

### SQL Injection

- **SQL Injection to List Users:**

  ```
  SELECT username, password FROM users
  ```

- **SQL Injection Error Messages:**

  ```
  You have an error in your SQL syntax
  ```

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- **XSS Payload in URL Parameter:**

  ```
  <script>alert('XSS')</script>
  ```

- **XSS in Form Input:**

  ```
  <img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
  ```
