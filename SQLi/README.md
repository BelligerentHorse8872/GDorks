## What is SQL Injection (SQLi)?

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a method used by attackers to manipulate the database of a web application through SQL code. It takes advantage of security vulnerabilities in the application to execute malicious SQL statements. When input fields are not properly sanitized, attackers can inject SQL commands, allowing unauthorized access to databases and sensitive data.

## Examples of SQL Injection (SQLi) Dorks

Here are some examples of SQL Injection (SQLi) dorks:

1. **Login Bypass SQLi Dork**: This dork can identify websites vulnerable to login bypass SQL Injection.

   ```
   inurl:/login.php?username=' OR '1'='1'--
   ```

2. **Error-Based SQL Injection Dork**: Identifies websites that may be vulnerable to error-based SQL Injection attacks.

   ```
   inurl:/product.php?id=1'
   ```

3. **Blind SQL Injection Dork**: Identifies sites potentially vulnerable to blind SQL Injection.

   ```
   inurl:/index.php?id=1 AND 1=1
   ```

4. **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection Dork**: Identifies websites that may be vulnerable to time-based blind SQL Injection attacks.

   ```
   inurl:/search.php?q=1' AND IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0)--
   ```


## Real-World Examples of Advanced SQL Injection Attacks

Here are some real-world examples that demonstrate the impact and severity of advanced SQL Injection attacks:

- **Case Study 1: Extraction of Sensitive Data**: Detailed account of a successful blind SQL Injection attack resulting in the extraction of sensitive user data.

- **Case Study 2: Advanced Chaining of SQL Injection Vectors**: A complex attack involving the combination of multiple SQL Injection techniques to gain administrative privileges.


For a broader range of SQL Injection dorks and detailed explanations of various techniques, explore the contents within the [GDorks repository](https://github.com/Ishanoshada/GDorks/).

## Understanding SQL Injection

SQL Injection can have severe consequences, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and data manipulation. It's crucial to understand various techniques such as Blind SQL Injection, Union-based SQL Injection, Error-based SQL Injection, and Time-based SQL Injection to prevent such attacks.
